# The Furnace

The Furnace is an essential part of every Foundry.

This Foundry VTT module brings Quality of Life Improvements to the VTT.  
It started by adding Drawing Tools, and then an experiemntal Macros system and now it also adds a 'Split Journal' feature. More QoL improvements are planned.

# Installation

Extract the furnce.zip file to the public/modules directory. As DM go to the `Manage Modules` options menu in your World ('?' icon on the side bar) then enable the `The Furnace` module.
