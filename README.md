# The Furnace

The Furnace is an essential part of every Foundry.

This Foundry VTT module brings Quality of Life Improvements to the VTT.  
It started by adding Drawing Tools functionality to FVTT and it now has many small QoL Improvement features, such as a 'Split Journal' feature, toggle vision for GM, move multiple tokens at the same time, and double click to edit initiative in the combat tracker. More QoL improvements are planned.

# Installation

Extract the furnace.zip file to the public/modules directory. As DM go to the `Manage Modules` options menu in your World ('?' icon on the side bar) then enable the `The Furnace` module.

With FVTT 0.3.7, you can now install this module automatically by specifying the following public module URL : `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kakaroto/fvtt-module-furnace/stable/module.json`
